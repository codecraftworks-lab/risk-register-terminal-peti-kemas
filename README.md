# Operational Risk Management & Quality Monitoring Dashboard – Port Operations

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains an **Operational Risk Management & Quality Monitoring Dashboard** designed to monitor, analyze, and communicate operational risks in **Port Operations** using a structured, data-driven approach. The dashboard provides visibility into current risk exposure, control effectiveness, and mitigation progress across departments to support managerial decision-making.

The solution is developed based on **Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)** principles and **ISO 31000**, integrating risk-based thinking and continuous improvement. In short: practical, decision-oriented, and manager-friendly.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Identify and map key operational risks in port operations
* Assess risk levels based on likelihood and impact
* Evaluate the effectiveness of existing controls
* Monitor mitigation progress across departments
* Support risk prioritization and data-driven decisions

---

## 📊 Dashboard Components & Metrics

### **1. Risk Summary Indicators**

* **Total Risks**: Total number of identified risks
* **High & Extreme Risks**: Priority risks requiring management attention
* **Risks with Ineffective Control**: Risks with inadequate or weak controls
* **Open Mitigation Actions**: Percentage of mitigation actions still ongoing

### **2. Control Effectiveness**

Pie chart showing the proportion of controls categorized as:

* Effective
* Partially Effective
* Ineffective

Used to assess the overall strength of internal control systems.

### **3. Risks by Department**

Treemap visualization displaying risk distribution across departments:

* Operations
* Procurement
* Commercial
* QA & SMO
* Risk Management
* IT
* Human Capital
* Services

Helps management focus on functions with higher risk exposure.

### **4. Mitigation Status**

Status of risk treatment actions:

* Completed
* In Progress
* On Hold

Provides a quick overview of mitigation progress.

### **5. Risk Level Distribution**

Distribution of risks by severity:

* Low
* Medium
* High
* Extreme

Supports prioritization of corrective and preventive actions.

### **6. Risk Matrix (5×5)**

Risk assessment matrix based on:

* **Likelihood**: Rare to Almost Certain
* **Impact**: Insignificant to Extreme

Visualizes risk severity and concentration areas.

### **7. Department Risk Register Snapshot**

Summary table showing:

* Department
* First Risk Level
* First Risk Status

Designed for executive-level overview and cross-functional monitoring.

## 🛠 Tools & Frameworks

* **Microsoft Excel** – Risk register and data processing
* **Dashboard Visualization** – Business intelligence–style dashboard design
* **Risk Management Frameworks** – ISO 31000, Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)

---

## 🗂 Data Source

Data is derived from an **Operational Risk Register**, including:

* Risk identification
* Likelihood and impact assessment
* Existing controls
* Mitigation status
* Risk ownership by department

All data is simulated and used solely for portfolio and learning purposes.

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

* High and Extreme risks represent a significant portion of the operational risk profile
* Most risks have mitigation actions in place, although some controls remain ineffective
* Operational and procurement functions show relatively higher risk exposure

These insights can support process improvement initiatives, control enhancement, and strategic decision-making.
